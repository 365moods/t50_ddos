T50 - Experimental Mixed Packet Injector

Legend:
+ Added feature
* Improved/changed feature
- Bug fixed
! Known issue / missing feature


T50 5.5 - February 3rd, 2015
 ! Changed the behavior of signals from RESTART to INTERRUPT.
 * The raw socket is NON BLOCKING now.
 ! Improved command line parser: No more duplicated options accepted!
     --protocol is case insensitive now.
 - Add call to tcp_help() to usage().
 * Support for RDRAND and BMI2 instruction set added.
 - Small bug when calculating IP address on t50.c fixed
 + Added some "post-mortem" debug routines
 * If sendto's errno is EPERM, show permission error message asking to check firewall settings.
 - Fixed bugs of modules memory allocations.
 * Code compiles fine with LLVM clang 3.x;
 * SSE is enabled by default in x86-64 architecture (commented on Makefile);
 * Changed return type of module funcions;
 * Small corrections on modules functions;
 * All files were converted to UNIX text format;
 * gre_encapsulation() was still not used on ospf.c;
 - Calls to sendto with second parameter were wrong;
 * Function ip_header() added to modules/ip.c.
 - On embeded systems the use of VLAs (Variable Length Arrays) in modules functions can be hazardous
    due to restricted stack space. "Differential" buffer reallocation on heap fix this problem;
 * cksum() 5 times faster now (summing QWORDs, DWORDs WORDs and BYTES, in that order);
 * Using a trick to deal with pointers of multiple types on modules functions;
 * New Makefile (still needs some tweaks) for better incremental compiling;
 * Minor fix on getOrdinalSuffix() function, no t50.c (11, 12 & 13 have a "th" suffix!).
 + Added comments with FIX, FIXME, NOTE prefix for better code reading.
 * Changed the way modules table are declared. See modules.c for advice.
 * Module table are not order dependant anymore!
 * Created src/help directory and src/include/help.h header to improve module "modularity".
 * Host name now can be a partial IP or name, optionally followed by "/cidr".
   Partial IP have the format 'a(.b(.c(.d)))'. Formats as 'a.b./cidr' are invalid.
 ! if a name or a full IP is given, the default cidr is 32. T50 will fail showing the message:
   "CIDR must be between 8 and 30.".
 - CIDR bug above fixed by Fernando MercÃªs.
 * socket descriptor isolated from anyone except sock.c.
 * "modules" just manipulates the packet buffer. main() actually sends the packet.
 * 'stdout' is now unbuffered on initialization. To avoid line buffer behavior oddities (if any).
 * Added -std=gnu99 to CFLAGS, on Makefile.
 ! Possible wrong way to calculate threshold for turbo mode.
 - Threshold bugs fixed. 
 ! Possible wrong way to threat SIGCHLD signal.
 - Added a SIGALRM handler and a timeout of 5 seconds when main process waits for child.

T50 5.4.1 - August 11th, 2013
 - Fixed bug in option parsing.
 - Fixed license missing in some files.
 * Depecrecation of gethostbyname() - thanks to Cooler
 * Improved code, reduced memory consumption - thanks to Frederico Pissara
 * Improved Makefile, reduced compilation time, use of SS3 instructions.
 * Removed private IP address restriction.
 - Manpage moved to section 8.
 + Strip set by default.

T50 5.4.0 - September 4th, 2011
 + New version scheme <MajorVersion.MinorVersion.RevisionNumber>.
 + Added manpage.
 * UPX and strip removed.
 * License limitations removed.
 * Removed libmath dependency.
 * New smaller Makefile reducing compile time. Many flags removed.
 ! We don't have support for IPv6 yet.
 ! T50 may not compile in other systems nor GNU/Linux distros.

T50 5.3 - April 9th, 2011
 + New License: it is, finally, licensed under GPL v2.0. Please, refer
 to LICENSE document for further information.
 + CIDR Support: Classless Inter-Domain Routing  support  for destination
   IP address,  using  a  really  tiny  C  algorithm.  This would allow
   the new version to simulate DDoS in a laboratory environment.
 + New protocols support: IGMP, EGP, RIP, DCCP, RSVP, IPSec, GRE, EIGRP
 and OSPF.
 + TCP Options support.

 T50 3.4 - November 10th, 2010
  First public release.
